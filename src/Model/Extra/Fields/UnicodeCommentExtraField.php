/**
 * Info-ZIP Unicode Comment Extra Field (0x6375):.
 *
 * Stores the UTF-8 version of the file comment as stored in the
 * central directory header. (Last Revision 20070912)
 *
 * Value         Size        Description
 * -----         ----        -----------
 * (UCom) 0x6375        Short       tag for this extra block type ("uc")
 * TSize         Short       total data size for this block
 * Version       1 byte      version of this extra field, currently 1
 * ComCRC32      4 bytes     Comment Field CRC32 Checksum
 * UnicodeCom    Variable    UTF-8 version of the entry comment
 *
 * Currently Version is set to the number 1.  If there is a need
 * to change this field, the version will be incremented.  Changes
 * may not be backward compatible so this extra field should not be
 * used if the version is not recognized.
 *
 * The ComCRC32 is the standard zip CRC32 checksum of the File Comment
 * field in the central directory header.  This is used to verify that
 * the comment field has not changed since the Unicode Comment extra field
 * was created.  This can happen if a utility changes the File Comment
 * field but does not update the UTF-8 Comment extra field.  If the CRC
 * check fails, this Unicode Comment extra field should be ignored and
 * the File Comment field in the header should be used instead.
 *
 * The UnicodeCom field is the UTF-8 version of the File Comment field
 * in the header.  As UnicodeCom is defined to be UTF-8, no UTF-8 byte
 * order mark (BOM) is used.  The length of this field is determined by
 * subtracting the size of the previous fields from TSize.  If both the
 * File Name and Comment fields are UTF-8, the new General Purpose Bit
 * Flag, bit 11 (Language encoding flag (EFS)), can be used to indicate
 * both the header File Name and Comment fields are UTF-8 and, in this
 * case, the Unicode Path and Unicode Comment extra fields are not
 * needed and should not be created.  Note that, for backward
 * compatibility, bit 11 should only be used if the native character set
 * of the paths and comments being zipped up are already in UTF-8. It is
 * expected that the same file comment storage method, either general
 * purpose bit 11 or extra fields, be used in both the Local and Central
 * Directory Header for a file.
